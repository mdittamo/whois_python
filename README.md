# whois_python
A little python script using the whois library. 
The Excel [x] option reads all values in the first column of the spreadsheet the user identifies. 
The rest of the script should be pretty self-explanatory. 

Required Libraries
pip install python-whois
pip install colorama
pip install xlrd
